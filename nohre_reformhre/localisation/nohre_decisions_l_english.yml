 restore_holy_roman_empire_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in Central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories. Through our conquests and aggressive diplomatic means we will be able to revive and declare the old empire restored."
